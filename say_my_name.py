# This is for exercise 8 and its aim is to become more familiar with pycharm and to output variables.
# variables are boxes in memory used to store data that can change
# A single '=' is the assignment operator. Without the '=' the object will not be assigned to the variable
#  the assignment operator is right-associated - this is saying that in line 7 the assignment operator assigns the right of the '=' to the variable which is on the left
# the print function writes to the standard output stream
# The comma between the two variables creates a space between them in the terminal
first_name = "Eleanor"
last_name = "Cooper"
print(first_name,last_name)
